# Validation Reports (historical)

These are *historical validation run reports*, documenting exploratory evaluations
against the TargetLab RAG service. They are NOT part of the canonical product
specifications or eval catalogue.

For current canonical eval definitions and artefact contracts, see:
- \`aigov-specs/docs/planning/Master-Plan-Traceability.md\`
- \`aigov-specs/docs/evals/eval_catalog.yaml\`

Retired or deprecated reports should be moved to \`docs/reports/deprecated/\`.
